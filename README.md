# Personal Security Policy for Home Devices

This policy outlines simple rules to secure home devices and build safe habits, protecting your data and privacy from cyber threats.

## Scope
This policy covers household devices: phones, personal computers, smart TVs, Wi-Fi routers.

## Security Rules

### Phone
- **Strong Passwords**: Use 12+ character passwords (e.g., “Ph0n3$3cur3!2025”). Short passwords (e.g., 6 characters) can be cracked in seconds.
- **Password Manager**: Use a secure manager like Bitwarden or local open-source Keepass to store unique passwords.
- **No Reused Passwords**: Each account needs a unique password to prevent breaches.
- **Avoid Modded Apps**: Only download apps from trusted stores (e.g., Google Play).
- **Update OS**: Enable auto-updates to patch vulnerabilities.
- **Limit App Permissions**: Grant only necessary permissions (e.g., no camera for games).
- **Screen Lock**: Use a strong password, not a 4-digit PIN, for the home screen.
- **Limit Bluetooth/GPS**: Turn off when not needed to avoid tracking.
- **Use VPN**: Enable a VPN (e.g., ProtonVPN) for secure browsing.
- **Secure Storage**: Store sensitive documents in secure apps, not the gallery.
- **Avoid Spam/Phishing**: Ignore suspicious SMS or links.
- **Restart Regularly**: Reboot weekly to clear potential threats.

### Smart TV
- **Auto-Updates**: Enable firmware/app updates for security patches.
- **Disable Microphone**: Turn off when not in use to prevent eavesdropping.
- **Monitor Activity**: Check for odd behavior (e.g., unauthorized apps).
- **Privacy Settings**: Review and restrict data sharing in TV settings.
- **Trusted Apps**: Download only from official stores (e.g., Samsung Store).

### Personal Computer
- **Strong Password**: Use 12+ character passwords (e.g., “PC$3cur3#2025”).
- **Update System**: Enable auto-updates for OS and apps.
- **Avoid Random USBs**: Don’t plug in unknown USB drives to prevent malware.
- **Backup Data**: Save important files to an external drive or secure cloud weekly.
- **Auto-Lock**: Enable screen lock after 5 minutes of inactivity.
- **Limit Permissions**: Grant apps only necessary access (e.g., no webcam for editors).
- **Disable Webcam/Microphone**: Turn off when not needed.
- **Password Manager**: Use Bitwarden or Keepass for secure password storage.
- **Use VPN**: Enable for secure internet access.
- **Antivirus**: Install trusted antivirus (e.g., Malwarebytes) and update regularly.
- **Shut Down Laptop**: Power off when away, not sleep, to prevent access.
- **Test Suspicious Software**: Use sandboxes or VMs for untrusted apps.
- **Disable Features**: Turn off unused Windows features (e.g., remote desktop).

### Wi-Fi Router
- **Use WPA3**: Set Wi-Fi encryption to WPA3 (or WPA2 if unavailable).
- **Change Credentials**: Update default router login to a strong password.
- **Update Firmware**: Check for updates monthly to fix vulnerabilities.
- **Disable WPS**: Turn off Wi-Fi Protected Setup to prevent easy hacks.
- **Guest Network**: Use a separate guest network for IoT devices like TVs.
- **Enable Firewall**: Turn on the router’s firewall for added protection.
- **Monitor Network**: Check connected devices weekly for unauthorized access.

## Security Habits
- **Don’t Log In on Others’ Devices**: If you do, log out and clear data.
- **Use Alt Accounts**: Avoid personal accounts on untrusted websites; use alternates.
- **Protect Credentials**: Don’t enter passwords in public; watch for onlookers.
- **Don’t Share Passwords**: Keep them private.
- **Secure Password Storage**: If written, store in a locked safe, not on paper.
- **No Reused Passwords**: Use unique passwords for all accounts.
- **Stay Aware**: Learn about phishing, trojans, and other cyber threats.


## Incident Response
If a device acts strangely (e.g., slow, unknown apps), disconnect it from Wi-Fi, run antivirus (if applicable), reset to factory settings, and change all passwords. Contact support if needed.
